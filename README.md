# Finnkino_api_webapp
A website that connects to Finnkino API to show movie schedules in different cinemas.

The main goal of this project was to create a website that uses an API to its benefit. I decided to make a website where visitors can check what's playing at their local cinemas.

Rest api requests are made in two ways: one using only vanilla JavaScript and one using a little bit of jQuery.

On the website visitors can search movies from all of the cinemas (not a function to be used in real-world but more of a showcase) or they can choose the cinema by area or by name.

The site displays some information of the movies and a link from which visitors can purchase their tickets.

Semi-responsive, not to be used with mobile-devices. Work in progress..
